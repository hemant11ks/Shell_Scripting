Notes:

A shell script is a plain text file containing commands. When executed, the shell runs these commands line-by-line just like typing them in the terminal.

🧾 Shell Script: file_checker.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Greet the user
echo "👋 Hello, $USER! Let's check a file."

# Ask for filename
read -p "📄 Enter the filename: " filename

# Check if file exists
if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
    echo "✅ File '$filename' exists. Here is the content:"
    cat "$filename"
else
    echo "⚠️ File '$filename' does not exist."
    echo "🛠️ Creating the file..."
    echo "This file was created by $USER on $(date)" > "$filename"
    echo "📂 File '$filename' created and initialized!"
fi

We can run it by:

Save as file_checker.sh
Make it executable: chmod +x file_checker.sh

Run script: ./file_checker.sh
